# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this report is to understand the impact of the Ninth Grade class's academic success on Thomas High School's overall performance.
In order to visualize the value of Thomas High's Ninth Grade class' academic success, I constructed a program that nullifies Ninth Grade statistics so that the disparity between 9th Grade performance and 10th-12th grade performance can be clearly represented.

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
 
 - Module: 79.0% AVG Math Score, 81.9% AVG Reading Score, 75.0% Passing Math, 85.8% Passing Reading, 65.2% Overall Passing
 - Challenge: 78.9% AVG Math Score, 81.9% AVG Reading Score, **77.1% Passing Math**, **88.3% Passing Reading**, **66.9% Overall Passing**

## Summary

### Below are four changes in the updated school district analysis after replaing Thomas High Ninth Grade with NaNs:
 1. Nullifying categories/subsets within a large dataset can present new trends, findings, and/or reasoning behind skewness.
 2. School Spending has little affect on Average School Scores.
 3. School Size appears to have no affect on School Scores...
 4. School Type appears to have no affect on School Size...
