# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this report is to understand the impact of the Ninth Grade class's academic success on Thomas High School's overall performance.
In order to visualize the value of Thomas High's Ninth Grade class' academic success, I constructed a program that nullifies Ninth Grade statistics so that the disparity between 9th Grade performance and 10th-12th grade performance can be clearly represented.
